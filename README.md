## Overview

In this design I was able to complete it within half a day which was a challenge I had put for myself. I chose the order summary card because it's a component I have come across in my profession a lot and any chance to improve my skills in any area is welcome.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I chose to use scss in this particular project.
The process was one I have refined.
Starts with going over the style guide and taking note of the requirements.
Setting up the necessary assets and tools I need.
Setting up the folder structure to keep everything organized.
Then lastly write the markup (HTML) and add styling and responsiveness later on.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
